## How it Works

CodeTranslify uses the power of the ChatGPT API to analyze and interpret code written in one programming language and then generate an equivalent version in the target language. This enables developers to explore and experiment with different languages while preserving the core logic of their code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/CodeTranslify.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd CodeTranslify`
3. Set up your ChatGPT API key (instructions in the [API Key Setup](API_KEY_SETUP.md) guide).
4. Install dependencies using Yarn: `yarn install`
5. Start the development server: `yarn dev`
6. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the CodeTranslify web interface.
